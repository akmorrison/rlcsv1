Tower Side Arduino High Level Pseudocode, Last updated May 28th

Loop function:
    Get readings from both DAQ sensors, update the sliding window filter
    If there's a message from the client:
        Update `global_time_last_contact`
        If it's an ACK:
            if there's a previously stored value `global_last_state_command`:
                update `global_tower_state`
                update the relays
            else:
                Tower has sent an ACK without us requesting an ACK.
                This is weird. I don't know what to do here, so do nothing
        If it's a state command:
            update `global_last_state_command`
            send an ACK request to the client
            update `global_time_last_ACK_request`
        If it's a status request:
            send `global_tower_state`
            send window filtered average of DAQ pressure readings
            send window filtered average of DAQ mass readings

    If `global_tower_state` != `global_last_state_command` and `global_time_last_ACK_request` was more than `TIME_BETWEEN_ACK_REQUESTS` ago:
        send another ACK request
    If it's been longer than `TIME_LOST_CONTACT_IGNITION_SHUTOFF` since `global_time_last_contact`:
        turn off the ignition relays
        update `global_tower_state`
    If it's been longer than `TIME_LOST_CONTACT_TOTAL_SHUTOFF` since `global_time_last_contact`:
        go to a safe state (valves in safest position, ignition off) (have to ask Yash what the safest positions are)
        update `global_tower_state`

constants:
    `TIME_BETWEEN_ACK_REQUESTS`: 500mS
    `TIME_LOST_CONTACT_IGNITION_SHUTOFF`: 3 seconds
    `TIME_LOST_CONTACT_TOTAL_SHUTOFF`: 10 seconds
